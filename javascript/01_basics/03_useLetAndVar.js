var num = 10;
console.log(num); // Output: 10

let str = "hello";
console.log(str);  // Output: hello


// Re-declaring the var variable
var num = 20;
console.log(num); // Output: 20

// Trying to re-declare the let variable will cause an error
// let str = "hi"; // Uncommenting this line will throw an error: Identifier 'str' has already been declared
